# TEN Network Association - A Brief Explainer
This document attempts to explain in simple terms what the TEN Association is and why it exists.

## The Association
The TEN Network Association ("Association") is an independent legal entity with legal capacity. It is a not-for-protfit organisation and does not pursue commercial purposes. It is governed by Swiss law. Its duration is unlimited. The official language of the association is English.  
The registered address office and administration is: Zug, Switzerland.  
The purpose of the Association is to directly or indirectly further the growth and development of the open-source TEN software protocol and the surrounding community as well as ecosystem. To serve this purpose, the Association plans and implements initiatives, including participation in initiatives with other organisations, for example, by providing financial grants.

## TEN Governance (DAO)
Members of the TEN ecosystem who want to be part of TEN's advancement can submit TEN Improvement Proposals, or TIPs. TIPs form part of the decision-making process for TEN through a combination of General Assembly votes and decentralized governance mechanisms using TEN tokens.

## TEN Governance Voting
To be eligible to vote, you must hold at least 1 TEN token for at least 30 days. This prevents flash loan attacks on the Association.

## Association Membership
There are two types of member: Founding Member (members present at the inauguration of the Association or designated by the Governance Committee within 1 month of inauguration) and Ordinary Member. Anyone can apply to the Governance Committee to become a member. Membership is not automatically granted for token holders. There is no membership fee and members may resign from the Association at any time, provided that they notify the Governance Committee at least 30 days in advance.

Members can be expelled by the Governance Committee following a majority vote by the General Assembly if a member is in breach of any the Association's regulations or if the member engages in behaviour which is detrimental to the interests of the Association.  

## Voting
Each ordinary member has one vote and each founding member has two votes.  
To be eligible to vote, you must be a member of the Association and you must hold at least 1 TEN token for 30 days.

## Association Structure
The bodies of the Association are:
  1. the General Assembly
  2. the Governance Committee
  3. other bodies, as determined by the General Assembly or the Governance Committee
  4. the auditors, if required

### The General Assembly
The General Assembly is the highest authority in a Swiss association. As such, changes to the powers of the General Assembly is the most burdensome therefore changes have to be considered very carefully and changes are made thoughtfully. Generally, the General Assembly is repsonsible for adopting and amending the articles and regulations which define how the Association operates. They can also elect and dismiss members of the Governance Committee.  

Meetings of the General Assembly are called at least 20 days in advance and all members are invited. Motions to be submitted for discussion at the meeting within 5 days after the invitation notice however they require support from at least 20% of the members to be accepted.

### The Governance Committee
The Governance Committee is accountable to the General Assembly and, by extension, to all the members of the association. The Governance Committee is responsible for the day-to-day management and administration of the Association. This includes implementing the decisions of the General Assembly, overseeing the Association's activities, managing finances, ensuring compliance with legal and statutory requirements, and establishing new bodies or committees. The Governance Committee's actions are subject to review and approval by the General Assembly, ensuring that the Committee acts in the best interests of the association and its members.

The Governance Committee, at a minimum, will be composed of the Association's president and two other members. The maximum number of members is nine. The president is a member of the Governance Committee eleceted to preside over the Governance Committee.
